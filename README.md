Tittle of the project: Blogging for you

My final year project title for android is Blogging for you which is an online photo blogging application where user can create their account and can login though it with the help of email and password. Here I have developed an application which is called Blogging for you that give its user a platform where they can post their day to day event, situation, topic in a blog an post it and get the feedback as a comment from other users. These application is all about posting the blogs by the user which can be seen by other user and can give their comment on the blogs. Here user only need to select a photo which they want to post with the status and category.  This app will help the user to post their thought among the other users and get there feedback as comment. 
This app is created with android studio using java as a programming language. It mainly focused to the people who can’t express their opinions, views regarding any topic in a real life but with help of these application they can express their thoughts, opinions without worrying any things. People will be able to rise the problem regarding any topic by posting a blog though which other people can give their views opinions.

Rest Client
Retrofit is a REST Client for Java and Android. It makes it relatively easy to retrieve and upload JSON (or other structured data) via a REST based web service. In Retrofit you configure which converter is used for the data serialization. Typically for JSON you use GSon, but you can add custom converters to process XML or other protocols. Retrofit uses the OkHttp library for HTTP requests.
To work with Retrofit you basically need the following three classes:
•	Model class which is used as a JSON model
•	Interfaces that define the possible HTTP operations
•	Retrofit. Builder class - Instance which uses the interface and the Builder API to allow defining the URL end point for the HTTP operations.
Every method of an interface represents one possible API call. It must have a HTTP annotation (GET, POST, etc.) to specify the request type and the relative URL. The return value wraps the response in a Call object with the type of the expected result. So it helps a lot while developing the project, connecting it to the API, getting value from database, adding data for every backend activities retrofit had played a big role here.
